        <h1 id="yoga-for-migraine">Yoga for Migraine</h1>
        <p>A student recently asked about simple postures that can help those who experience migraine headaches. Below I have outlined a few simple asanas and breathing exercises that might provide some relief to those of you with migraine:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Ujjayi breathing to calm the nervous system. <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/article/practice-section/what-is-ujjayi/">Click here</a> for more information.</li>
        <li>Practice gentle forward bends: (utanasana, balasana, and adho mukha swastikasana)</li>
        <li>Practice viparta karani using a bolster. <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/legs-up-the-wall-pose/">Click here</a> for more information.</li>
        <li>Use an eye-pillow in savasana to help the muscles and nerves relax.</li>
        <li>Meditate. I often recommend anapana.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When experiencing migraine, it is recommended to avoid deep forward bends and inversions such as downward facing dog and the wheel pose, and keep your hands by your sides in standing poses such as mountain pose and warrior variations.</p>
        <p>To prevent migraine, keep your hands at the sides when practicing standing poses. Poses such as standing forward bend, bridge and plow are also recommended.</p>
